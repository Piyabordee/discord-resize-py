## ü§ñ Development Process (‡∏Ç‡∏±‡πâ‡∏ô‡∏ï‡∏≠‡∏ô‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏û‡∏±‡∏í‡∏ô‡∏≤)

This project was developed with the assistance of an AI programming partner (Google's Gemini) for code generation, debugging, and explaining concepts.

However, the core architecture, technology stack selections, and all key feature decisions were directed and implemented by the project owner. The AI served as a development tool, while the project's vision and direction were human-led.
